Hi 👋, I’m Udit Thakur — an AI enthusiast and current MSc Artificial Intelligence student at the [University of Amsterdam (UvA)](https://www.uva.nl/en). I enjoy building practical ML systems and exploring areas like RL, NLP, CV, and Audio Intelligence. I’m also a Kaggle Competition Master and love learning through hands-on experimentation. 

After finishing my bachelor's, I realized I wanted to dive deeper into how AI really works—not just use the tools, but understand the stuff behind them. With how fast everything’s moving in the AI world, doing a master’s felt like the right step to explore research, learn the theory properly, and get hands-on with the latest ideas. It's been a fun (and intense) ride so far, and I’m really enjoying pushing myself in new directions.

Outside of tech, you’ll find me gaming 🕹️, watching football ⚽️, or hitting the gym 💪.
