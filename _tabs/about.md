Hi, I’m Udit Thakur — an AI enthusiast and current MSc Artificial Intelligence student at the University of Amsterdam. I enjoy building practical ML systems and exploring areas like RL, NLP, CV, and Audio Intelligence. I’m also a Kaggle Competition Master and love learning through hands-on experimentation. Outside of tech, you’ll find me gaming, watching football, or hitting the gym.
